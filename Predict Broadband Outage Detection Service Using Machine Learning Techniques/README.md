# Broadband Outage Detection

### Problem Description:

India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer dissatisfaction because of broadband outages. 
   
The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it believes impact the `outage_duration`. They have tracked three different outage durations, `0` for no outage, `1` for short outages that last anywhere between a few minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and `2` for long outages that can last from 2 hours to sometimes even a couple of days. 
   
You will now have to use these metrics that the company has tracked to create a machine learning model that will be able to predict the `outage_duration` so that the company can better handle outages and improve customer satisfaction and therefore reduce customer churn.
   
### About Data:

There are 7 CSV files provided to us, they are described below:

- `train_data.csv`: It has a unique event `id` for each observation of the `outage_duration` in a particular `area_code`

- `test_data.csv`: Similar to the train dataset, we are provided with an `id` and an `area_code`, we are expected to predict the `outage_duration` for each of the records

- `broadband_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `student_test.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `broadband_type` that is stored in the dataset. There are `10 different types` of broadbands that are observed in the dataset

- `outage_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `student_test.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `outage_type` that is stored in the dataset. There are `5` different `outage_type`'s recorded in the dataset.

- `report_data.csv`: For each event `id` there are `log_report_type` and `volume` columns are recorded. `log_report_type` is a type of the recorded report generated by a technical team member after evaluating the outage. `volume` is the volume of data handled in the area at the time of report in custom company specific units.

- `server_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `student_test.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `transit_server_type` that is stored in the dataset. Transit Servers handle the requests and responses of the customers.

- `sample_submission.csv`: The format of CSV file required for submission to the evaluation backend

The different `broadband_type`â€™s are given below:

			{
			broadband_type_8 : 'ADSL 1',
			broadband_type_2 : 'ADSL 2',
			broadband_type_6 : 'ADSL 2+',
			broadband_type_7 : 'Cable',
			broadband_type_4 : 'Fiber 1',
			broadband_type_9 : 'BPL',
			broadband_type_3 : 'Fiber 2',
			broadband_type_10 : 'Fiber High Speed',
			broadband_type_1 : 'Fiber Ultra',
			broadband_type_5 : 'Fiber Ultra Max'
			}

### Description of the columns present in the dataset.

- `id` is the instance where the event was recorded when there was an outage in the broadband connectivity in an area 

- `area_code` is a categorical column, in which each unique value refers to an area where the `outage_duration` has been measured

- `broadband_type` is the technology that the ISP uses for delivering broadband internet connection, there can be multiple types of broadband connections in a single area 

- `outage_type` signifies the `5` different types of outages as classified by the engineering experts who remotely diagnose the issue, once reported 

- `log_report_type` column signifies one of the `386` different types of reports generated by customer service representatives who record issues and classify them as one of the `386` different types of issues 

- `transit_server_type` is the type of transit server that handles the traffic of data and route the incoming and outgoing web traffic 

- `volume` is the recorded data, in masked units, for 10 minutes prior to the time of recording the observation as per custom company specific units.

### Evaluation Metric:

The evaluation metric used for this hackathon would be the **F1 Macro Average**
